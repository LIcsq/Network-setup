            <h2>Personal Profile</h2>
            <p>Throughout this year, I dedicated over 500 hours to learning in the DevOps field, faced many challenges, and I do not intend to stop there. I love working in a team because together we can achieve much greater results. I already have practical experience working at EPAM this experience has made me realize that I am ready for the challenges that may arise in future. I have a B1+ level of English language; therefore, communication works out fine. I thrive in challenging situations by seeking innovative solutions and looking for ways to tide over them.</p>

            <p>Trainee DevOps Engineer | 01/2024 – Now</p>
            <p>Participated in a three-month training program, working closely with a mentor who provided practical assignments that I had to complete. At the end of each assignment, there was a code review. The tasks were challenging, such as writing a utility in Python for backing up MySQL and PostgreSQL databases using only SQL. During this training, I also learned and practiced various DevOps skills, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Utilized Git for efficient version control and collaboration.</li>
                <li>Automated workflows with Python scripting.</li>
                <li>Administered Linux systems for optimal performance and security.</li>
                <li>Managed and configured networking infrastructure.</li>
                <li>Containerized applications using Docker.</li>
                <li>Implemented CI/CD pipelines with Jenkins.</li>
